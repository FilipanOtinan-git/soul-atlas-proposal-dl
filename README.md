Soul Atlas x Dami Lee | Strategic Partnership Proposal

"Building legends, one cornerstone at a time."

This repository contains the strategic framework and interactive prototype for a high-stakes partnership landing page. The goal is to move Dami Lee from a "cold lead" to a Founding Architect for the Soul Atlas 2027 film project in Lisbon, Portugal.

🏛️ Project Objective

To pitch a "Noir High-Fantasy" cinematic vision where architecture is the lead character. By shifting the outreach from a service-based request (Work) to a value-based partnership (Legacy), we position this collaboration as a career-defining opportunity for a top-tier creator.

📈 The Strategy: Conversion Like Page Framework

This project implements four critical shifts to maximize conversion:

The "Legacy" Hook: Overhauling the headline from a vague "collaboration" to a specific design challenge: The Architecture of a Beautiful Lie.

Personalized Narrative: Removing formal "Dear Dami" letters in favor of a Creative Brief style that speaks directly to her expertise in spatial psychology.

The "Gap" Section: Replacing generic company history with a targeted "Why You?" section, specifically referencing her impact on our world-building studio.

Architectural Constraints: Converting passive lore dumps into active design hurdles (e.g., building on the ruins of the "Atlas Empire") that engage an architect's problem-solving nature.

✨ Key Features

Cinematic Prototype: A high-fidelity HTML/CSS landing page featuring blueprint grid overlays and a "Noir" aesthetic.

Tiered CTA: A strategic "No-Risk" call to action that offers a "Paid Roast/Critique" option—providing Dami with high-value YouTube content even if she can't commit to the full project.

Authority Proofing: Showcasing AAA-level production standards (Project Leilani) to establish peer-level trust.
